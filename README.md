# GreenLineSnake
Final project for EC327 Intro to Software Engineering, Summer 2015

A new twist on a classic game: a Snake App modeled after Boston's Green Line. 
Repair the green train by collecting T logos and avoiding snowballs.

This App was developed using SFML Graphics libraries with C++.
Growth/movement of snake is modeled with a list algorithm, coordinates and growth stored as variables defined by Train class.
Position of T logo and start position of snowballs are randomly generated coordinates.
Developed an algorithm for radial motion by generating circle of random radius to define the path.
